# Icon Processor

Used for automatically applying modifications to the Visual Studio Icon library SVG files to make the icons suitable for dark mode. This is hacky and fragile, and could absolutely break if the icons change.

## Usage
 ```
 pnpm run start "../../playground/src/assets/editor/vs-icon-library"
 ```
